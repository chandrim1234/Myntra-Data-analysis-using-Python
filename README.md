# **Myntra Data Analysis Using Python**
## **Objective**
The objective of this project is to analyze Myntra's product data to gain insights into pricing, discounts, customer preferences, and trends using Python. The project involves data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving actionable insights.

## **Scope of Work**
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Web scraping Myntra product data using **Selenium or Scrapy** (if permitted)  
   - Using existing datasets from Kaggle or other sources  
   - Collecting data related to product categories, prices, discounts, ratings, reviews, and brand names  

2. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicate entries  
   - Converting data types (e.g., price as float, reviews as integers)  
   - Standardizing categorical data (e.g., brand names, categories)  
   - Feature engineering (e.g., deriving discount percentage)  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzing the distribution of product prices  
   - Finding correlations between discount percentages and customer ratings  
   - Identifying the most popular product categories and brands  
   - Studying seasonal trends in pricing and discounts  

4. **Data Visualization**  
   - Bar plots for top-selling brands  
   - Box plots for price distribution across categories  
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis  
   - Line charts for discount trends over time  

5. **Predictive Analytics (Optional)**  
   - Building a simple regression model to predict product prices based on features  
   - Using sentiment analysis on reviews (Natural Language Processing with NLTK or TextBlob)  

6. **Insights & Business Recommendations**  
   - Identifying the best discount range for maximum sales  
   - Understanding the price range most customers prefer  
   - Analyzing customer sentiment to improve product offerings  
   - Suggesting product categories that have high demand  

## **Tools & Technologies**  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **SQL (if database integration is needed)**  

## **Expected Outcome**  
- A well-structured dataset ready for analysis  
- Visual insights into Myntraâ€™s pricing, discounts, and customer preferences  
- A report with key findings and business recommendations.
